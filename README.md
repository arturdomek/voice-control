This is a program for running voice recognition from microphone.
Just run in terminal, and adjust your mic input volume.
Make sure that mic input level is not too high.

Note:
This is an early version of program.
For now it is possible to control the music player Clementine using the command "play" and "pause".
For more information, check the file main.py in folder python_executor.

Use command:
./run.sh
