To create your own plugin:
* copy the example folder and rename it
* modify file sample.grammar
* modify file sample.voca (you should use dict file to find the words)
* run script make_dict.sh
* modify sample.commands

* open file plugins.jconf and append path to your .dfa and .dict files

Now you can use your plugin.
